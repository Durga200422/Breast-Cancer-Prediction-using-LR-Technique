This project is a machine learning-based breast cancer prediction model developed using Logistic Regression (LR). The model was selected after rigorous comparison with multiple algorithms due to its superior accuracy. The project is implemented as a Flask application and deployed on the Render platform, allowing users to access the application via a web interface.
# BreastPredict: Early Breast Cancer Risk Assessment

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women globally and ranks second in mortality rates. Early and accurate detection is vital to improving survival rates and reducing treatment costs. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop an automated system for diagnosing breast cancer based on clinical data. By providing an accessible and accurate diagnostic tool, this project aims to aid healthcare professionals and contribute to the fight against breast cancer.

## About the Dataset


The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. It was compiled by Dr. William H. Wolberg and contains a comprehensive set of patient demographics, clinical details, and histopathological information. Diagnosis in the dataset includes identification of malignant or benign tumors based on clinical examinations and imaging results.

The Breast Cancer Prediction dataset contains medical and demographic information of 570 patients. 

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset includes the following features derived from clinical and histopathological analyses:

**Features**

**ID:** Unique identifier for each record.

**Diagnosis:** Indicates whether the tumor is malignant (M) or benign (B).

**Mean, Standard Error, and Worst (Maximum) Values for Each Feature:**

For each cell nucleus, the dataset provides three measurements: mean value, standard error, and the "worst" (maximum) value. These are calculated for ten characteristics:

**1. Radius:**

Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.

Features: radius_mean, radius_se, radius_worst.

**2. Texture:**

Standard deviation of gray-scale values.

Features: texture_mean, texture_se, texture_worst.

**3. Perimeter:**

Perimeter of the nucleus.

Features: perimeter_mean, perimeter_se, perimeter_worst.

**4. Area:**

Area of the cell nucleus.

Features: area_mean, area_se, area_worst.

**5. Smoothness:**

Local variation in radius lengths.

Features: smoothness_mean, smoothness_se, smoothness_worst.

**6. Compactness:**

Perimeter¬≤ / Area - 1.0.

Features: compactness_mean, compactness_se, compactness_worst.

**7. Concavity:**

Severity of concave portions of the contour.

Features: concavity_mean, concavity_se, concavity_worst.

**8. Concave Points:**

Number of concave portions of the contour.

Features: concave_points_mean, concave_points_se, concave_points_worst.

**9. Symmetry:**

Symmetry of the nucleus.

Features: symmetry_mean, symmetry_se, symmetry_worst.

**10. Fractal Dimension:**

‚ÄúCoastline approximation‚Äù - 1.

Features: fractal_dimension_mean, fractal_dimension_se, fractal_dimension_worst.

### Total Features:
30 numerical features (10 characteristics √ó 3 measurements).

1 target variable (diagnosis).

31 Columns in Total.



The dataset also includes the Breast Cancer status of each patient (Malignant or Benign), making it well-suited for classification tasks. Specifically:

Malignant Instances: 212

Benign Instances: 357

# Project Workflow

## Preprocessing

* Cleaned the dataset to remove irrelevant or redundant data.

* Standardized features to ensure consistency in scale.

## Model Training and Evaluation:

* Compared various algorithms including Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

* Logistic Regression (LR) was selected for its accuracy and performance metrics.

* Evaluation metrics:

    * Accuracy: 0.9912

    * Log Loss: 0.3161
# Key Findings

Logistic Regression outperformed other models:

* Accuracy: 99.12%

* Log Loss: 0.3161

* Other models like NN, SVM, DT, RF, and KNN exhibited lower accuracy and higher losses.
## Deployment

The Logistic Regression model was deployed using Flask and hosted on the Render platform, making it accessible as a web application.
